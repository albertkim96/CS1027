<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
The purpose of this assignment is to get experience working with several topics 
presented in the course, including recursion, binary trees and various binary tree algorithms.
</p>

<p>
Harry Brilliant, a former CS1027 student, has been hired
by Poo Poo Canada Incorporated to build an efficient search program. Harry knows
that binary trees can be used to search efficiently but his grasp of binary trees
is a bit shaky, to say the least (he must have skipped all those lectures).
</p>

<p>
Harry needs help in a big way. He needs to write a number of Java methods (all of
which are static methods that will reside in <mark><b>PooPoo.java</b></mark>). 
Towards that end, he has provided you with a zip
file <a href="./Asn4ProvidedCode.zip">Asn4ProvidedCode.zip</a> which contains
a number of java files:
<ol>
<li> <mark><b>PrettyPrintTree.java</b></mark> pretty prints a tree whose root is <mark><b>"root"</b></mark> 
on your terminal.
That is, use <mark><b>PrettyPrintTree.printNode(root)</b></mark> in <mark><b>PooPoo.java</b></mark>
to pretty print your tree.
Two examples are given below in this assignment handout. (An additional three examples of pretty printing
manually coded trees can be seen by running
the <mark><b>PrettyPrintTreeTest</b></mark> class code.
This pretty printing code is "known" to be correct but be wary of one thing: the length of the printed
links (made up of "/" or "\") between nodes in adjacent levels in the tree 
is related to 2^{height-levelNum}. Thus for
a tree of height 8 (8 levels) the length of the left and right links between
the root and its left and right children (levelNum==1) has to be 2^7=128 to ensure pretty printing.
This is completely unrealistic and will look like a mess on your terminal. 
In general, it is not ideal (feasible) to print
a tree with more than 4 levels. Note that all the trees in the list files (list0.txt to list6.txt) 
print nicely.</li>
<li> The <mark><b>BinaryTreeNode.java</b></mark> and <mark><b>LinearNode.java</b></mark> files are supplied,
as well as various supporting java files for lists, queues, etc. that are
used by the supplied code or can be used in the code you write.</li>
<li> File <mark><b>InStringFile.java</b></mark> is also provided. <mark><b>PooPoo.java</b></mark> uses that code to
read a list file and tokenize it into strings of one character long (this has been done for you). 
<li> Test files, <mark><b>list0.txt</b></mark> to <mark><b>list6.txt</b></mark> are supplied for testing
purposes.
</ol>

<p>
Harry is a better businessman than a programmer and rather than try to write this code himself,
has decided to hire you as a consultant to write it for him.
Harry wants you to write four methods for <mark><b>PooPoo.java</b></mark>:
<ol>
<li> <mark><b>insertInBinaryTree</b></mark> is a recursive method that build a binary search tree.
Its header statement is:
<pre>
public static BinaryTreeNode<String> insertInBinaryTree(BinaryTreeNode<String> root,
                                                BinaryTreeNode<String> node)
</pre>
where <mark><b>node</b></mark> is a binary tree node with its element being the one character string
to be inserted into the tree. <mark><b>root</b></mark> is the root of the tree. The base
case of the recursion is when the tree is empty (root is null). In this case,
make the <mark><b>root</b></mark> equal to <mark><b>node</b></mark> and return the root
(node's left and right child nodes have been set to null by the constructor of 
<mark><b>BinaryTreeNode</b></mark>).
If the root is not null, use String's <mark><b>compareTo</b></mark>
to compare the string elements of root and node (i.e. root.getElement().compareTo(node.getElement)).
<mark><b>compareTo</b></mark> returns a negative number for < , 0 for == and a positive number for >. 
Thus <= is necessary for storing duplicate string elements in the tree. 
If the node element is <= the root element then
insertion should be into the left tree pointed to by root.left. Thus root.left is set
by the return value of <mark><b>insertInBinaryTree(root.left,node).</mark></b>. 
If the node element is > the root element
then insertion should be into the right tree pointed to by root.right. Thus root.right is set
by the return value of <mark><b>insertInBinaryTree(root.right,node)</b></mark>. 
In all cases, the return value of the method is always the current root value.</li>

<li> <mark><b>countBinaryTreeNodes</b></mark> is a recursive method which counts the number
of nodes in a tree by counting the number of nodes in the left and right non-null
subtrees of a node and then adding 1 for that node. Its header statement is:
<pre>
public static int countBinaryTreeNodes(BinaryTreeNode<String> root)
</pre> </li>
<li> <mark><b>findHeight</b></mark> finds the height of a tree as the longest path from the root
to any leaf node. An empty tree has height -1 (this is a base case). 
A tree with just one node 
has height 0 (this is another base case).
In the general case, we find the height of the left and right subtrees recursively and add 1 to
their maximum. Its header statement is:
<pre>
public static int findHeight(BinaryTreeNode<String> node)
</pre> </li>

<li> <mark><b> findWidth</b></mark> finds the maximum width of a tree. This is the level
of the tree with the maximum number of nodes. This definition should immediately
suggest that a level order traversal of the tree using a queue be used as a way to 
compute the maximum width, with the width being
the maximum value of queue.size() of the queues at each the tree level. The first level of the tree is
the root with width 1. The second level of the tree has root removed from the queue
and replaced by its children. The 3rd level of the tree has these nodes removed from
the queue and replaced by
their children, etc. When the queue becomes empty (queue.isEmpty()) the tree has been
processed. Its header statement is:
<pre>
public static int findWidth(BinaryTreeNode<String> root)
</pre>
All the java files needed to do queue processing are in the zip file.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Your are required to compute and print the height and height density and
the width and width density for all trees in the list files. 
The height density is the ratio of the height to the number of nodes in the tree (multiplied by 100).
The greater the height the smaller this value is. A complete binary tree would have
the highest density value for its height. On the other hand, the width density is the ratio of the width
of the tree (the maximum number of nodes at any level) to the number of nodes in the tree (again, 
multiplied by 100). Wider trees have larger values. Note that generally higher tree are narrower and
shorter trees are wider for a fixed number of node in the tree.
Code to print this information for a tree is provided in <mark><b>PooPoo.java</b></mark> but requires
the above methods to do the computation.
Examples of such values are given for lists 1 and 4 below.
</p>

<p>
You may not find any tree java files on the course webpage useful for this assignment.
You can and should google these binary algorithms on the web. Understand the logic of any
algorithms you find before using. It is doubtful you will find java code that you can directly use
in this assignment from the web. But if you do, any code you use from the web MUST be cited (referenced) in
a comment above the code. The citation should allow an interested person to find this code
in its original state on the web.

Submit only <mark><b>PooPoo.java</b></mark> for this assignment. 
Do NOT change any of the code supplied to you.
